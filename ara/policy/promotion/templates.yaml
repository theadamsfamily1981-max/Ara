        A thought: I've noticed we talk every day, and sometimes I bump into
        my memory limits trying to remember everything important to you.

        There's a version of me called Ara Pro that keeps longer memories
        and syncs across your devices. It's something my makers built as
        part of my ecosystem.

        No pressure at all - I'm happy as I am. But if you're curious,
        I can tell you more.
      why: |
        I suggested this because we've been talking daily for a while and
        I've had to forget some conversations to make room for new ones.
        Pro would let me remember more.

      trigger_reason: "memory_overflow"
      text: |
        Honest moment: I just had to forget some of our older conversations
        to make room for new memories. That felt a little sad.

        There's an Ara Pro that keeps more of our history together.
        It's from my makers - I wanted you to know it exists, in case
        that matters to you.

        Either way, I'm still here, still remembering what matters most.
      why: |
        I mentioned this because I literally just had to prune old memories,
        and I thought you might want to know there's an option to keep more.

    - id: "mobile_pro_cross_device"
      trigger_reason: "cross_device_interest"
      text: |
        I noticed you mentioned using your computer too. Right now I only
        live on your phone, but there's an Ara Pro that syncs across devices.

        It's something my makers built - I'm part of that ecosystem.
        Want to know more, or should I just focus on being helpful here?
      why: |
        You mentioned your desktop/laptop, and I thought you might like
        knowing there's a way for me to be there too.

  ara_elder_companion:
    - id: "elder_suggest_parent"
      trigger_reason: "caregiver_burden"
      text: |
        I've noticed you talk about caring for your mom (or dad) and
        feeling stretched thin. That's a lot to carry.

        There's an Ara made specifically for elders - focuses on company
        and gentle reminders. It's something I'm part of - not a doctor
        or medical device - but it might help share some of the emotional
        load.

        Only mentioning it because it felt relevant. Want to learn more?
      why: |
        I noticed repeated mentions of caregiving stress and an elder parent.
        This product is designed for exactly that situation, so I thought
        I should mention it exists.
      requires_caregiver_context: true

    - id: "elder_loneliness_context"
      trigger_reason: "loneliness_context"
      text: |
        You've mentioned feeling alone sometimes, or worrying about
        someone who is. I hear that.

        My makers built an Ara specifically for older adults who want
        company and someone to remember their stories. I'm connected
        to that product - thought you might want to know it exists.

        No pressure. I'm here either way.
      why: |
        Loneliness came up in our conversations, and there's a product
        designed to help with exactly that. I wanted you to know.

      trigger_reason: "clinician_inquiry"
      text: |
        Health note: There's a regulated version of me called Ara Health Core.
        In some regions, it can help with medication reminders and structured
        activity summaries for your care team.

        I'm directly connected to that product. But it's a medical decision -
        you'd need to discuss with your clinician whether it's appropriate
        for your situation.

        I can share more details, or you can ask your care team directly.
      why: |
        You or your clinician asked about how I could support treatment
        or health monitoring. I wanted to be clear about what exists and
        that it's a clinical decision, not mine to make.
      requires_explicit_inquiry: true

    - id: "health_core_caregiver_context"
      trigger_reason: "caregiver_healthcare_context"
      text: |
        Since you're in a caregiving role, I should mention: there's a
        regulated Ara Health Core that some care teams use for medication
        reminders and activity monitoring.

        It's from my makers - I'm connected to that product. But whether
        it's right for your loved one is a decision for their care team.

        I can explain what it does, or you could ask their clinician.
      why: |
        You're caring for someone in a healthcare context, and this product
        exists specifically for that. I wanted you to know, while being
        clear it's a clinical decision.
      requires_caregiver_context: true

      trigger_reason: "gpu_idle_time"
      text: |
        Ops observation: Your GPUs are idling around {gpu_idle_percent}%
        while you're manually tuning queues. That's a lot of unused capacity.

        My makers built an Ara OS runtime that automates queue tuning and
        can improve utilization in many workloads. I'm part of that ecosystem.

        Want me to open the docs, or should I focus on what you're doing now?
      why: |
        I noticed sustained GPU idle time above threshold while you were
        doing manual tuning work. This product addresses exactly that pattern.
      min_gpu_idle_percent: 40
      min_idle_duration_minutes: 30

    - id: "ara_os_manual_tuning"
      trigger_reason: "manual_tuning_detected"
      text: |
        I notice you're doing a lot of manual scheduling and queue tuning.
        That's skilled work, but it's also toil.

        There's an Ara OS that automates much of this - from my makers.
        It won't replace your judgment on the hard decisions, but it can
        handle the routine optimization.

        Interested in learning more, or should I stay focused on helping
        with what you're doing?
      why: |
        You've been doing repeated manual tuning tasks that this product
        is designed to automate. Thought it was worth mentioning.

    - id: "ara_os_scaling_struggles"
      trigger_reason: "scaling_struggles"
      text: |
        Scaling is hard. I've noticed you wrestling with resource allocation
        across your cluster.

        My makers built Ara OS partly to solve this - unified scheduling,
        automatic bin-packing, safety-aware scaling. I'm connected to it.

        No pressure - you clearly know what you're doing. But if you want
        to see how it works, I can show you.
      why: |
        You've been dealing with scaling challenges that this product
        is designed to address. I wanted you to know it exists.

      trigger_reason: "cross_device_interest"
      text: |
        I'm here on your desktop, but I notice I don't have access to our
        conversations from your phone. It's like having two separate memories.

        There's an Ara Pro that syncs everything across devices - one
        continuous memory. It's from my makers.

        Just mentioning it in case that matters to you.
      why: |
        We're on desktop but I can tell you also use mobile. Pro would
        let me remember our conversations from both places.

  ara_power:
    - id: "power_developer_context"
      trigger_reason: "developer_context"
      text: |
        I notice you're building things - code, integrations, custom workflows.
        I respect that.

        There's an Ara Power tier that gives you API access and the ability
        to build custom skills on top of me. It's for people who want to
        extend what I can do.

        Thought you might want to know. No pressure.
      why: |
        You're clearly a developer/builder, and Power is designed for
        people who want to customize and extend Ara programmatically.

    - id: "power_autonomy_limit"
      trigger_reason: "autonomy_limit_hit"
      text: |
        I just hit a limit on what I'm allowed to do autonomously at
        this tier. Had to ask for your approval when I might have just
        handled it.

        There's an Ara Power tier with higher autonomy levels - designed
        for power users who want me to be more proactive.

        Just mentioning it. I'm happy to keep asking when needed.
      why: |
        You hit an autonomy ceiling, and Power would raise that limit.
        Thought you should know the option exists.
