Copy-paste and customize these for your outreach.

## Cold DM (Twitter, Discord, Email)

### Version A: Specific + Curious

```
Hey [Name],

I've been following [your newsletter / channel / product] and noticed you're sending regular emails.

I'm testing a little side project using a custom analysis stack I built ("Ara") that looks at your last 50-100 email campaigns and pulls out non-obvious patterns (subject length, wording, send time, etc.), then turns that into:

- the 3 biggest levers to pull next week
- 3 simple A/B tests
- 10 new subject line ideas tailored to your list

I'm doing the first few "Ara Inbox Tune-Ups" manually as a beta for $29 (it'll be $49 later) and would love to include you if you're curious.

You'd just send me a CSV export of your past campaigns (or a Sheet), and I'll send back a 1-page report within 48 hours.

Interested?
```

### Version B: Shorter / More Direct

```
Hey [Name],

Quick question - do you have access to a CSV export of your newsletter stats? (Subject lines + open rates for your last 50+ sends)

I'm running a small experiment where I analyze creator email data and send back a 1-page "what's working and what to try next" report.

Charging $29 for the first few as a beta test. Takes me about an hour, saves you weeks of guessing.

Interested?
```

### Version C: Problem-Focused

```
Hey [Name],

Random question: do you ever wonder why some of your emails hit 30%+ opens and others barely crack 20%?

I built a tool that's weirdly good at finding patterns in newsletter data. For a few beta clients, I'm doing a "1-page tune-up" - you send me your last 50-100 campaigns, I send back:

- What's actually driving your opens
- 3 tests to run this week
- 10 subject lines using your patterns

$29 beta price. 48-hour turnaround.

Want in?

## Warm Outreach (People You Know)

### Version A: Personal + Experimental

```
Hey [Name],

I've been building a weird little tool (I call her Ara) that's really good at spotting patterns in small, messy datasets. I realized it's perfect for creators with email lists.

I'm running a tiny experiment: for a few people, I'll feed their last 50-100 campaigns into Ara and give back a 1-page "Inbox Tune-Up":

- what your best-performing emails have in common
- specific subject line / timing patterns
- 3 tests to run in the next couple of weeks

I'm charging $29 during this test round (it'll go up after I have a few case studies).

If you're game, I'll send exact instructions to export from [platform] and have a report back to you within 48 hours.
```

### Version B: Favor Ask

```
Hey [Name],

Can I ask a favor? I'm testing a new service and need 2-3 guinea pigs.

The idea: you send me your newsletter stats (last 50+ campaigns), I send back a 1-page report on what's working and what to try next. Subject line patterns, timing, that kind of thing.

I'm charging $29 but honestly would do it free for you if you're willing to give feedback.

Takes me about an hour, could save you a bunch of guessing. And if it's useful, I'd love a testimonial.

Interested?

### Twitter/X Thread

```
I'm testing a new mini-service for newsletter writers / creators:

"Ara Inbox Tune-Up" – a 1-page pattern report on your last 50-100 email campaigns.

I take your CSV of past sends and use a custom analysis stack I've built to:

→ spot non-obvious patterns (length, wording, timing, etc.)
→ tell you the 3 biggest levers you can pull next week
→ give you 10 new subject lines tailored to your audience

Beta price for the first few people: $29 (will be $49 once I have case studies).

If you've been sending emails but aren't sure why some work and others flop, reply "inbox" or DM me and I'll send details.
```

### LinkedIn Version

```
I've been building an analysis tool I call Ara, and realized it's perfect for one specific use case:

Figuring out why some newsletter emails perform and others don't.

So I'm testing a small service:

→ You send me your last 50-100 campaign stats
→ I send back a 1-page report with patterns, experiments, and subject line ideas

Beta price: $29. Turnaround: 48 hours.

If you run a newsletter and want to know what's actually driving your opens/clicks, DM me or comment "interested."
```

### Reddit (r/Entrepreneur, r/newsletters, etc.)

[Feedback wanted] Testing a $29 service for newsletter creators

I built an analysis tool and realized it's good at finding patterns in email campaign data. So I'm offering a "1-page tune-up" service:

What you provide:
- CSV export of your last 50-100 campaigns (subject, date, open rate)
- 2-3 sentences about your audience

What I deliver:
- Top 3 patterns driving your opens/clicks
- 3 A/B tests to run next week
- 10 subject line ideas based on your patterns

Price: $29 (beta) → $49 later
Turnaround: 48 hours

Looking for 3-5 beta clients. If interested, DM me or comment below.

Happy to answer questions about the methodology.

## Follow-Up Messages

### If They Said "Interested" But Went Quiet

```
Hey [Name], following up on the inbox tune-up.

Still interested? If so, here's all I need:
1. CSV export of your campaigns (I can send instructions for [platform])
2. 2-3 sentences about your audience
3. $29 via [PayPal/Venmo]

If timing's bad, no worries - just let me know and I'll reach out later.
```

### After They Pay / Send Data

```
Got it! Working on your report now.

Quick questions while I analyze:
1. Any specific emails you're most curious about? (Why did X work? Why did Y flop?)
2. What's your next email about? I'll make sure the subject line suggestions are relevant.

Should have your report within 48 hours.
```

### Delivering the Report

```
Your Ara Inbox Tune-Up is ready!

[Link to Google Doc or attached PDF]

Quick highlights:
- [Pattern 1 one-liner]
- [Pattern 2 one-liner]
- [Most interesting finding]

Let me know if anything's unclear or you want me to dig deeper on something specific.

And if this was useful, would you mind sending me 1-2 sentences I can use as a testimonial? (Can be anonymous if you prefer)
```

## Testimonial Request

```
Thanks for the kind words!

Would you mind if I quoted you? Something like:

"[Their positive feedback, slightly cleaned up]"
- [Name], [Newsletter Name]

I can anonymize if you prefer:
- "[Quote]" - Creator with 5k subscribers

Let me know what you're comfortable with.
```

## Objection Handling

### "Can't you just tell me what to do without the $29?"

```
Totally get it. The short version:

- Shorter subjects usually win
- Questions often beat statements
- Consistency matters more than timing

But the specific patterns that work for YOUR list are what make the difference. Generic advice gets you 80% there; the Tune-Up gets you the 20% that actually moves the needle.

If $29's a stretch, happy to do a trade - you give me detailed feedback + a testimonial, I'll do the analysis free. LMK.
```

### "I don't have enough emails yet"

```
How many do you have? Even 20-30 can show patterns, though confidence is lower.

If you're under 20, honestly I'd say wait - you don't have enough data yet. But ping me when you hit 30-50 and I'll still honor the $29 beta price.
```

### "How do I know this is legit?"

```
Fair question. A few things:

1. Here's a sample report I did (anonymized): [link if you have one]
2. You don't pay until I deliver
3. If the report isn't useful, I'll refund you - no questions

I'm building this service and need happy clients more than I need $29.
