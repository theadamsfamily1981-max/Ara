## Scaling Path

| Stage | Volume | Approach |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Beta | 1-3/week | Fully manual |
| Early | 5-10/week | Template-heavy, batch processing |
| Growth | 20+/week | Partial automation, hire VA |
| Scale | 50+/week | Full automation, self-serve |

For now: stay manual. Learn what clients actually want.
