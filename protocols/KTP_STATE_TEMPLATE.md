# KTP State Template

**The Wand Format**

Use this template to track a living knowledge transfer session.
Each problem gets its own state file. The state evolves; it is never restarted.

---

## Problem

> What we're pointing the wand at.

(One sentence. What is the core question or mystery?)

---

## Allegory

> The narrative mapping that makes the problem tractable.

(What story/metaphor encodes this problem? River, maze, field, knot, cathedral, etc.)

**Allegory → Formalism mapping:**
| Story Element | Formal Object |
|---------------|---------------|
| ... | ... |

## Known Structure

### Must Be Preserved (Invariants)
-
-
-

### Hard Constraints
-
-
-

### What We Already Have
- (theorems, lemmas, working code, validated experiments)
-
-

---

## Open Gaps

### Unknowns
-
-

### Tensions
- (Where do two good ideas conflict?)
-

### Expected Drift / Bullshit Zones
- (Where do we expect the model to hallucinate or oversimplify?)
-

## Iteration Log

| Version | Date | Focus | Outcome |
|---------|------|-------|---------|
| v1 | | | |
| v2 | | | |
| v3 | | | |

### Detailed Notes

#### v1
- What we tried:
- What worked:
- What broke:
- Next mutation:

---

## Current Status

- [ ] Toy version exists
- [ ] Scaffold built
- [ ] Attack in progress
- [ ] Conjecture formed
- [ ] Lemma proven
- [ ] Full resolution

**Confidence:** (hallucination / heuristic / conjecture / theorem)

---

## Next Wand Invocation

> What should the next iteration focus on?

- Preserve:
- Mutate:
- Tighten:

*"Point the wand at X" = select a subproblem and say: evolve that while respecting the rest.*
