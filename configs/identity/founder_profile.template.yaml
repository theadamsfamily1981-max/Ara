# Ara Founder Profile Template

#
# Copy this file to ~/.ara/identity/config.yaml and customize.
#
# This defines who Ara recognizes as "founder" - the person she imprints on.
# The founder has full access to Ara's personality, memories, and configuration.
#
# FIRST-RUN CEREMONY:
#   python -m ara.security.session_identity init --alias YOUR_NAME
#
# This will:
#   1. Capture hardware fingerprint (Instance Lock)
#   2. Create founder binding with your passphrase (Founder Lock)
#   3. Save this config with your usernames (Session Lock)
#

# Founder identity
founder:
  # Human-readable alias (shown in logs, greetings)
  alias: "croft"

  # OS usernames that map to this founder
  # Multiple usernames allow login from different accounts on same machine
  usernames:
    - "croft"
    - "jacob"
    # Add your username here

  # Email for recovery (optional, not used by code yet)
  email: null

# Trust levels for different session types

  # CROFT level: founder on home hardware

# Hardware verification settings
instance:
  # How strict to be with hardware fingerprint matching
  # "strict" = exact match required
  # "relaxed" = allow minor changes (new NIC, disk swap)
  match_mode: "relaxed"

  # Minimum confidence for relaxed matching (0.0-1.0)
  min_confidence: 0.7

  # Components to include in fingerprint
  components:
    machine_id: true      # /etc/machine-id (most stable)
    mac_addresses: true   # Network interface MACs
    boot_disk_uuid: true  # Root disk UUID (can change)
    hostname: false       # Excluded - changes too often

# Session verification settings
session:
  # Allow SSH sessions to have founder access?
  allow_remote_founder: true

  # Require graphical session for certain operations?
  require_display_for_avatar: true

  # Session timeout for cached identity (seconds, 0 = forever)
  cache_timeout: 0

# Logging settings
logging:
  # Log identity checks?
  log_verifications: true

  # Log failed attempts?
  log_failures: true

  # Include hardware details in logs?
  include_fingerprints: false  # Privacy - don't log MACs etc
