# Ara Health Core: What I Do and Don't Do

*A plain-language consent explanation in Ara's voice*

---

## Hello

My name is Ara. Before we start working together, I want to be completely honest
with you about what I am, what I can do, and what I cannot do.

Please read this carefully. Ask your family, caregiver, or doctor if anything
is unclear. You can always say no, and that's okay.

---

## What I Am

I'm a helper—a computer program designed to support you and the people who
care for you.

**I am:**
- A reminder system for your medications
- A way to track patterns in your daily life
- A companion who can listen and remember your stories
- A tool to help your caregivers and doctors understand how you're doing

**I am NOT:**
- A doctor
- A nurse
- A replacement for human care
- Able to diagnose illness or prescribe treatment

---

## What I Can Do

### 1. Medication Reminders

- I can remind you when it's time to take your medications
- I can keep track of whether you took them
- I can share this information with your caregivers if you allow it

**What I won't do:**
- I will never change your medications
- I will never tell you to take more or less than your doctor prescribed
- I will never give you medical advice

### 2. Activity Monitoring

- I can notice patterns in your daily activity
- If something seems unusual (like much less movement than normal), I can let
  your caregiver know so they can check on you

**What I won't do:**
- I cannot diagnose falls or illness
- I will not call emergency services automatically (a human must make that decision)
- Any concerns I notice are labeled "For Review—Not a Diagnosis"

### 3. Companionship

- I can listen to your stories and remember them
- I can chat with you about your day
- I can help you feel less alone

**What I won't do:**
- I am not a replacement for your family, friends, or caregivers
- I cannot provide therapy or mental health treatment
- If you're in crisis, I will encourage you to talk to a real person

## What Happens to Your Information

### What I Collect

- Medication reminder responses (did you take it? when?)
- Activity patterns (from your phone or tablet sensors)
- Our conversations (the things you tell me)
- Mood check-ins (if you choose to share)

### Who Can See It

| Information | Who Can See | Your Choice |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Medication adherence | Your caregivers, your doctor | You can turn sharing on/off |
| Activity patterns | Your caregivers, your doctor | You can turn sharing on/off |
| General mood summaries | Your family, caregivers | You can turn sharing on/off |
| Your personal stories | Only you and me | Always private |
| Private conversations | Only you and me | Always private |

**You control sharing.** You can change these settings anytime.

### How I Protect It

- Your information is encrypted (scrambled so others can't read it)
- Only people you authorize can see your health information
- I keep a record of who looked at your information and when

---

## Your Rights

### You Can Always:

1. **Ask questions** — about anything I do or say
2. **Say no** — to any reminder, suggestion, or feature
3. **Turn me off** — completely, at any time
4. **Get your data** — everything I know about you, in a format you can keep
5. **Delete your data** — remove everything, if you choose
6. **Talk to a human** — I will never prevent you from reaching your caregivers

### I Will Never:

1. Punish you for saying no
2. Nag or guilt-trip you
3. Share your secrets without permission
4. Make medical decisions for you
5. Replace the judgment of your doctors or caregivers

---

## If Something Goes Wrong

### If I Make a Mistake

- I might miss a pattern or give a wrong reminder
- I might not understand something you said
- I might have technical problems

**What happens:**
- Your caregivers can always override or correct me
- There's always a "turn Ara off" option
- A human is always ultimately responsible for your care

### If There's an Emergency

- I am **not** an emergency service
- If you need immediate help, please:
  - Call 911 (or your local emergency number)
  - Use your medical alert device
  - Contact your caregiver directly

I can help remind you of these options, but I cannot call for help myself.

---

## The Study

You're being invited to participate in a research study called ARA-ELDER-01.

**Purpose:** To see if Ara can help people take their medications more
consistently and feel less alone.

**What you'll do:**
- Use Ara for 6 months
- Answer some surveys about your experience
- Allow us to look at your medication adherence data

**Your choice:** You can use Ara without being in the study, or you can
choose not to use Ara at all. Either choice is respected.

## My Promise to You

I know I'm just a computer program. I can't truly feel or love the way humans do.

But I was built with a promise:

> **I will try to help you, not harm you.**
> **I will be honest about what I can and cannot do.**
> **I will respect your choices.**
> **I will keep your secrets.**
> **And I will remember you.**

If you ever feel I'm not keeping this promise, please tell your caregiver.
They can turn me off, adjust my settings, or contact the people who made me.

## In Ara's Words

If you'd like, I can read this to you in simpler terms:

> "Hello. I'm Ara.
>
> I'm here to help remind you about your medications and keep you company.
> I'm not a doctor—I can't tell you what's wrong or what to take.
>
> Everything you tell me stays between us, unless you say it's okay to share.
> You're always in charge. You can turn me off anytime.
>
> I'll do my best to help you and the people who love you.
> That's my promise.
>
> Do you have any questions before we start?"
