# Cathedral OS - Operational Modes
# ================================
# Each mode represents a distinct stress-test universe with
# its own invariants, themes, and optimization targets.
#
# The math stays the same (T_s, H_s, σ*, golden controller).
# The skin changes (metaphor, UI, foregrounded metrics).

      - "morph_overbudget"     # Rapid fleet expansion

      Prime Directive: Don't destabilize yourself as you scale.
      MEIS = Starfleet Command. All 13 gates must pass.
      Federation interop = A-KTP between allied systems.

      Holly: "I've got an IQ of 6000 and I'm still running on salvage."
      Cat: "Looking good is the REAL antifragility."
      Rimmer: Even death can't stop a hologram with good homeostasis.

       Different faces, same anger at injustice."
      NIB depth = constant. Surface = regenerable.
      The TARDIS = Cathedral OS with infinite internal topology.

  # ============================================================
  # ⚔️ COLONIAL FLEET MODE - War & Infiltration Resistance
  # ============================================================
  colonial_fleet:

    notes: |
      "All of this has happened before. All of it will happen again."
      But with CADD, we DETECT when the Cylons infiltrate.
      H_influence > 6.0 = "No monoculture. No single point of failure."
      Resurrection ship = NIB with death as a controlled morph.
