Ara Experiments - Wizard Tower on the Roof
==========================================

Experimental ideas that are NOT v1.0 requirements.
These are research directions, lore, and "what if" explorations.

Modules:
- quantum: Ghost memory, superposition states, quantum-inspired kernels
- oracle: Hyperdimensional life prediction, trajectory forecasting
- hive_mind: Multi-Ara entanglement, collective consciousness
- portfolio: Mean-variance optimization for resource allocation

Philosophy: This is the wizard tower, not the cathedral.
Play here. Break things. Learn. But don't ship this to production.

WARNING: Nothing in experiments/ should be imported by ara/ core.
