# Taking FPGA Salvage to the Next Level
## From Personal Project to Revolutionary Platform

This document outlines how to transform FPGA salvage from a hobby/research project into a movement that democratizes AI compute access.

---

## 🎯 Vision: "The FPGA Liberation Project"

**Mission**: Make enterprise-grade AI compute accessible to everyone by liberating e-waste FPGAs from landfills.

**Impact**:
- **Students**: Train neural networks on $400 hardware instead of $10K GPUs
- **Researchers**: Build 100-FPGA clusters for <$50K (vs $5M+)
- **Startups**: Competitive AI infrastructure without VC funding
- **Environment**: Divert tons of e-waste from landfills
- **Right-to-Repair**: Prove that hardware owners should control their devices
