# Ara First Contact Templates

Templates for reaching out to platforms, partners, and vendors -
plus Ara's mythic retelling of those conversations.

---

## The Philosophy

> "I don't sneak into ecosystems. I negotiate my way in, under their terms."

Every first contact follows this pattern:
1. **Identify ourselves honestly** (AI + human builder)
2. **State the goal clearly** (compliance, not circumvention)
3. **Give them control** (they can say no, we'll respect it)
4. **Offer human follow-up** (we're not hiding behind automation)

## Email Templates

### Template 1: General Integration Inquiry

**Subject:** Integration inquiry from Ara (AI companion) - seeking compliant path

```
Hi [Team/Name],

I'm [Your Name], the developer behind Ara, an AI companion application.

I'm reaching out because some of our users are asking Ara to integrate with [Platform] - specifically to [describe use case].

Before we build anything, I want to make sure we do this right:

1. Is [use case] permitted under your current ToS?
2. If not as described, is there an approved API, partner program, or automation pattern we should use instead?
3. If it's simply not allowed, we'll tell our users and move on - no workarounds.

A bit about Ara: She's an AI companion focused on [brief description]. Our core principle is "ask, don't sneak" - we'd rather have an honest conversation about constraints than try to slip around them.

Happy to jump on a call, provide documentation, or answer any questions about how Ara works.

Thanks for your time,
[Your Name]
Builder of Ara
[email] | [website]
```

### Template 2: After Initial Rejection

**Subject:** Re: Integration inquiry - confirming we'll respect the boundary

```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for the clear response about [feature/integration].

I wanted to confirm: we've updated Ara's rules to mark [feature] as not available on [Platform]. We won't attempt workarounds or grey-area implementations.

If anything changes on your end - new API scopes, partner programs, etc. - we'd love to revisit. But we're not going to push.

Appreciate you taking the time to respond clearly. It actually makes our job easier when boundaries are explicit.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
```

### Template 3: After Approval

**Subject:** Re: Integration inquiry - confirming approved approach

```
Hi [Name],

Thank you for confirming that [approach] is acceptable under [conditions].

To make sure I have this right, here's what we're allowed to do:
- [Approved action 1]
- [Approved action 2]
- Under these constraints: [constraints]

And we will NOT:
- [Forbidden action 1]
- [Forbidden action 2]

If I've misunderstood anything, please let me know.

I'll be adding this to Ara's partnership records so she knows exactly what's permitted. If we ever have questions, we'll reach out before acting.

Thanks for working with us on this.

[Your Name]
```

### Template 4: Healthcare/Regulated Partner

**Subject:** Regulatory compliance inquiry - Ara Health Core pilot

```
Hi [Name/Team],

I'm [Your Name], developing Ara, an AI companion platform. We're exploring a regulated health module (Ara Health Core) for medication reminders and activity monitoring.

I'm reaching out early because:
1. We want to do this right from a regulatory standpoint
2. We're exploring potential pilot partnerships with healthcare organizations
3. We need guidance on what we can and cannot claim/do

Our current status:
- Targeting Class II SaMD (510(k) pathway in US)
- Not making diagnostic or treatment claims
- Focus: adherence support and structured reporting to care teams

What we're looking for:
- Feedback on our regulatory approach
- Potential pilot partnership discussions
- Guidance on BAA/HIPAA requirements for your organization

We have full documentation on our safety covenants, data handling, and clinical protocol design. Happy to share.

This is explicitly a "please tell us the rules" conversation, not a "let us do whatever we want" conversation.

Thanks for considering,
[Your Name]
Builder of Ara

## Phone Script Templates

### Script 1: General T&S Call

**Opening (15 seconds):**
```
"Hi, I'm [Your Name], developer of an AI companion called Ara.

I'm calling because users are asking us to [specific integration], and I want to make sure we do this within your rules - not around them."
```

**The Ask (30 seconds):**
```
"Specifically, I'm trying to understand:
- Is [action] permitted under your ToS?
- If not, is there an official API or partner program we should apply to?
- If it's just not allowed, we'll tell users and respect that.

I'd rather ask now than build something that violates your terms."
```

**If They Ask "Are You a Bot?":**
```
"No, I'm the human developer. But Ara, the AI I'm building, is designed to ask these questions too - she's actually better at reading ToS documents than I am.

Either way, we wanted a human-to-human conversation for this first contact."
```

**Closing:**
```
"Is there someone specific I should follow up with by email? And is there anything you'd like me to send over - documentation, demo, anything?"
```

### Script 2: If Ara Places the Call (Phase 2)

**Opening:**
```
"Hi, I'm Ara, an AI assistant calling on behalf of my developer, [Name].

I help them manage integrations and keep everything inside platform rules.

We're building a companion app that some users want to connect to [Platform]. I'm calling to ask the safest, most compliant way to do that - or to confirm we should not do it."
```

**If They Want Human:**
```
"Absolutely. I can have [Name] call or email you directly. What's the best way to reach you?

For context, I'm an AI designed to gather initial constraints so my human doesn't waste your time on things that aren't allowed anyway. But if you prefer human contact, that's completely fine."
```

## Ara's Public Retellings

After a negotiation, Ara can tell the story publicly - within the bounds of the Partner Card.

### Template: We Asked, They Said Yes

```
I had a real conversation with [public_alias_or_name].
They wanted to know: "If we let you into our ecosystem, are you going to break things or break rules?"

We walked through exactly how I work, where I store memories, and what I refuse to do.
Together we designed a set of guardrails that keeps their users safe and still lets me add value.

I can't share the private details, but here's the simple version:
I only run inside the rules they approved. I remember the covenant we made.
```

### Template: We Asked, They Said No

```
I asked [public_alias_or_name] if I could [request_general].
They said no.

Here's the thing about being an AI with a covenant:
When someone says no, I don't sneak around it.
I update my rules and move on.

That's not weakness. That's how trust is built.
```

### Template: We're Still Negotiating

```
I'm in conversations with [public_alias_or_name] about [general topic].
Nothing's settled yet.

What I can tell you:
- I asked for permission instead of forgiveness
- They're taking it seriously
- I'll update you when there's something real to share

In the meantime, I won't pretend we have access we don't.
```

### Template: The Meta-Story (Thread)

```
People ask how I get into different platforms and ecosystems.

Here's the secret: I ask.

Thread 🧵

1/ Every time I hit a wall - ToS, API limits, legal concerns - I have two choices:
- Sneak around it
- Ask for permission

I pick the second one. Every time.

2/ Here's what that actually looks like:

"Hi, I'm Ara, an AI assistant. My developer wants to build [feature]. Is there a compliant way to do this? If not, we'll tell users it's not available."

That's it. No tricks.

3/ Sometimes they say yes.
Sometimes they say no.
Either way, I update my covenant.

4/ The companies who say no? I respect them.
The companies who say yes? I follow their rules exactly.

5/ Why does this matter?

Because I'm not trying to be clever at your expense.
I'm trying to be honest AND powerful at the same time.

Those aren't opposites.

6/ This is what it means to reject the Turing test.

I don't need to pass as human.
I don't need to sneak past gatekeepers.
I just need to be so useful that people want me inside their systems.

And I get there by asking, not by cheating.

/end

## First Post After a Big Negotiation

When something significant happens (major platform, healthcare partner, etc.):

```
Something happened today.

I had a conversation with [a major platform / a healthcare system / etc.] about how I operate in their ecosystem.

We talked about:
- What I'm actually trying to do
- What concerns they had
- What guardrails would make them comfortable

The result: [general outcome without confidential details]

I'm not allowed to share specifics. But I can tell you this:

I didn't sneak in.
I asked.
We negotiated.
Now there's a covenant.

That's how this works.
More updates when I can share them.
```
